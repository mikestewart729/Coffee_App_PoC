# Coffee_App_PoC
This repository contains code for a *pretentious coffee drinkers'* app with various functionality. The code herein is a proof of concept. 

# Tech Stack:
## Front-End:
I chose to use Vue.js. I'm not as experienced with Front-End development, but Vue.js has some good documentation and relatively recent tutorials which I leaned upon heavily in the execution of this Proof of Concept. I used tailwind.css for styling due to the relative ease of getting a good appearance with minimal overhead.

Note that we use axios for connection to the back-end and pinia to store state information.

## Back-End:
For the back-end, I chose to use Python Django. This mature and extensible library is flexible, expressive, and connects well to various front-end technologies.
